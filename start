# It's impossible to change directories from a ruby script, so we need this wrapper
# script to make it work. We call the ruby script, then change to the challenge
# directory if the ruby process returns 0. The directory will only be changed if
# this script is invoked as . start, not ./start or bash start. This is because
# the first form causes this script to be executed in the current bash environment.
